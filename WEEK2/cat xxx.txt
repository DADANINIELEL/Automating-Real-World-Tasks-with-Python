The customer service here is very good. They helped me find a 2017 Camry with good condition in reasonable price. Campared to other dealers, they provided the lowest price. Definttely recommend!
You will find what you want here

I've being look around for a second handed Lexus RX for my family and this store happened to have a few of those. The experience was similar to most car dealers. The one I ended up buying has good condition and low mileage. I am pretty satisfied with the price they offered.
Good deal for a 2015 RAV4

Called them to look for a second-hand RAV4 and they are very nice and patience to help me find me a few matches then scheduled an appointmet with me. Came in and they had everything ready for me. I was surprised how professional those sales are and they explained and answered all my questions. Ended up buying the car and been using it for more than a month now. Everything looks good!
Best experience so far

My friend recommended this place and  I decided to give a try. I called them beforehand and made sure they have the models I was looking for. They evenly sent me a bunch of photos and specs of the car I was looking for. One the day I visited, the sales person John helped me with test drive and showed me what I should be aware of when buying a used car. I felt like I learned a lot. They made the process so smooth that I saved a lot of time. It's the best car purchasing experience I had so far!
Waste of my time

I came in around 6pm and they seemed about to close the store. One of the sales seemed not being patient with me and made me feel like I have to either buy a car or come back later. Of course I didn't buy a car there. Hopefully they can treat every customer with more patience.
